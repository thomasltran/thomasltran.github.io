Stayed up until 6 to work on a project, and spent the whole day still working on it. Not a good excuse, but I should be more rested tomorrow to hit chest.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1o1zwoi">Water shut off at the apartment tonight. Was gonna try to fit some push-ups in to keep the muscles warm, but I guess I’m taking a full rest day.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-173du5b">Lowkey due for something good at this point. Ever since spring break everything has been on a downhill trajectory. I think the only thing I really have the means to fully manage and control in my life is the gym. Just gotta keep focusing on it and it’ll be the way out.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rsoywi">The issue is that I can’t let go of something until I’m satisfied with the way it’s finished. The move would be to straight up have a cutoff time where I go to bed at, and that way I’ll always have time for the gym in the morning. Need to learn how to detach from things. I think that’s another reason why I like the gym so much. It’s simpler to detach from reality when I need to concentrate everything on lifting, and that becomes therapeutic in a way. Maybe that’s why I used to enjoy playing video games when I was younger.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-11f6q1c">Looking forward to the chest pump tomorrow. Absolutely no way I’m gonna have a repeat of today.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ps3hsh">To better days ahead…</p></div></article> </body></article>
