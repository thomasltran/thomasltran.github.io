Still having trouble falling asleep, shut off at around 1. Woke up at 5:45 to my alarm and energy levels were depleted. Decided to postpone the gym until later in the day and tried sleeping again. Finally shut off at around 7 and woke up at 12.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1hlxr26">Probably around 174-176 right now. Felt it in the gym too. Tried going for 250 (+7) on the incline hammer strength, but couldn’t get the initial lockout. Down to 4 ish reps with 240 (+7) now. Had to drop down some more so I could reach like 6+ reps. Everything else stayed pretty much the same except for the first movement.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-14aoyy7">Proportions are looking better. At peak bulk, my waist was just a little smaller than my upper body so it looked kinda blocky. The taper is looking better now, and I’m starting to see the striations peek through a little. Still have a lot more work to do, but getting excited. Need to start relying more on feeler reps to adjust what weights I work with as my strength decreases.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xhsjf">Might need to cut out incline dumbbells and find a machine or something. Not sure what it’s called, but I tweaked the area above my right collarbone a couple weeks ago. Just gets triggered a bit every time I carry heavier dumbbells. Don’t feel it for any other movement though.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1wm0d8r">Gym is closed tomorrow, so I’ll have to do back at the apartment gym. Not too ideal because there’s like no dedicated back equipment, but I’ll make it work.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ps3hsh">To better days ahead…</p></div></article> </body></article>
