Also probably gonna cut cardio to 5 days a week. Got classes all day Monday and Wednesday, so it’s just more convenient to skip it on those days. Saves me money too since I can just eat at D2 for breakfast/lunch everyday.

I feel like it’s counterproductive to eat below what’s necessary to replenish your energy levels for a long period of time. Sure it’s required to lose weight, but the trade-off isn’t worth it to me. Got other stuff I need to focus my attention to besides the gym. I want to think of the gym as a supplement to my lifestyle rather than a chore. Like having a six-pack and insane physique sounds good to me, but I can’t let it take over everything else in my life. It’s not gonna pay off my bills in the future or anything.
