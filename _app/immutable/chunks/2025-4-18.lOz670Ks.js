Night time gym sessions always hit if the gym is empty. Haven’t trained legs as hard as I would like since my injury in August. Currently I’m just doing hamstring curls and leg extensions at about 70% compared to last year. Pretty much took out anything that can potentially put stress on my lower back. Hopefully it keeps getting better in the next couple of months, or else I might have to hop on to BPC 157 or something.",s,u,I="But other then that, I also do light back extensions to rehab my lower back and abs on leg day too.
