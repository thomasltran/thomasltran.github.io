At Audrey Moore, the benches are like angled at the most forward position. Typically, I’d prefer if the angle was way less sharper, or if it was flat for shrugs. I decided to go ahead with it anyways, but lower the weight a bit.",i,u,$="Not sure if it’s genetics or how I train them but my traps haven’t grown that much. I’m pretty sure it’s just my body composition though, but I’ve seen a lot of videos saying to lean slightly forward when doing shrugs to maximize growth. As such, I tried to incorporate that.",v,p,T="My first set went okay, although it felt a little bit weird. It was a combination of the bench angle and how high up I was from the ground. My second set was when it hit though. I picked up the db’s, and got into an upright position, and was beginning to lean forward. I think I went too far though, and I felt my entire lower back like pull upwards. It felt like a shock that spread super quickly from the base of my back around the tailbone area all the way up. Not gonna lie, I was super scared that I would get paralyzed or something. Pretty sure it’s just a hyperextension or muscle strain or something.",I,g,q="I watched a video on YouTube a couple of days before about someone who got surfer’s myelopathy, so I was pretty cautious about my exercise selection (especially for legs) going into this week.

The first time was in 2022 near the beginning of my journey, and I think I popped a disc or something doing RDL’s. This time was different though, since it felt like the whole lower back was pulled.
