Started off good—leg extensions felt great today. All the leg press machines were taken, and there was another person already waiting in line. Whole lot of waiting going on today. Decided to hit some heel-elevated squats. Can’t remember the last time I’ve squatted, but it must’ve been before I started cutting or close to the beginning of it. Tried out 135 of rip, but it was feeling super sketchy. My form has definitely gotten worse, and my back felt like it was super fragile. I was trying out the super wide grip that Sam Sulek usually does too, but it wasn’t feeling good. Dropped the weight to 115 and tried to crank out reps best I could. Not going back to squat racks again if I can help it, gonna stick with the leg press machines since I feel safer.",o,i,v="Did a quick run-through of my abs at the dorm gym. Was about to run a bit late to get to D2 before it switched to lunch prices, so I basically just pumped out reps. I think abs are looking more defined? Not too sure, but I think using heavier weight helps me feel the contraction more as opposed to lighter (which is what I’ve generally been doing since watching a video from Jay Cutler). Not being too afraid to increase calories a bit the past couple of days to help with digestion, but I think I’m still just maintaining weight for now.
