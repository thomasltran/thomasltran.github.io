It’s been like 2 weeks I think since I’ve had a proper arm day at McComas, so I think the form got a bit rusty. I think I can go a little heavier though, especially for bicep movements. I’ve generally stuck to higher rep ranges for arms because the weight that’d be manageable at 4-6 reps would mess up my form. For arms, I like to have the feeling/contraction. Still though, higher rep ranges (8+) feel a little too easy, and for something like incline curls I lose my focus after like 1 set. Gonna keep experimenting.
