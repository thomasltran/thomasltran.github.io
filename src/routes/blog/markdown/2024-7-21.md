Hopping on creatine tomorrow. Been drinking a lot more water, but I'm not sure if it's enough yet.

Legs were okay today. Ate at a buffet before so I felt pretty lethargic. Not sure if staying within the 4-6 rep range is good because I barely feel it afterwards. Like it's nice to lift pretty heavy, but at the same time I don't feel the muscle working that much. Definitely getting stronger though.

Trying to learn how to make friends at the gym. I've been a lot more social lately in terms of like offering to let people work in. It's a nice feeling seeing how happy they get.

Can't wait to see the changes in the next couple of weeks.

To better days ahead...
