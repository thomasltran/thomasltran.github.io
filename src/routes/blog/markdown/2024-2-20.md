Decent back pump today. Went a little higher on weight. Probably want to throw in some days where I just focus on moving as much weight as possible. Does increase the risk of injury but it does sound fun. Also want to try out a new attachment for lat pulldowns next time. Been using the straight bar this entire time, so I want to see what the other ones feel like. Used the high-low row machine today too since it was open. Didn’t feel that good—I think I might prefer the cables more, but it’s nice to change it up every once in awhile.

Basically back to pre-Sunday weight. Digestive system got messed up past 2 days. Hopefully it’s back to normal now. I guess introducing too much of a significant change into my diet doesn’t work out.
