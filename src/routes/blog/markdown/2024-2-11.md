Standard arm day. Tried to go up higher in weights for tricep movements. Typically got like 6-8 reps. Not sure if I like being in this range compared to like 8-10 reps, but I get a good pump either way. Still trying to figure out a good spot for volume.

Finished up pretty quickly too. I sort of timed my rest in-between sets. Usually I just go when I feel good, but wanted to save time today. Doesn’t feel too bad doing it this way, but I definitely felt like I needed more rest sometimes during the workout.

Also got a bit distracted with the vascularity by the time I got to incline dumbbell curls. Looked super sick, but it distracted me from focusing on the movement. Pretty happy with how it looked, but my arms without a pump are super skinny so that’s an unfortunate side effect of the cut.

Probably gonna end off the day on like 1400-1500 calories. Didn’t have a lot of options for food today, but I’m trying to dial in the diet this week anyways so it’s not an issue.

To better days ahead…
