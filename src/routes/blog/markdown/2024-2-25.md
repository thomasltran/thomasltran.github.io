Tried out a new attachment for lat pulldowns today. Opted for a neutral grip type thing that I’ve seen Sam Sulek using. Felt pretty decent. I Even though the bar looks like it should be hitting my mid-back more, I think that I feel less of that. Either way, it felt nice and I got a decent pump. Fixing up my form for the single arm pullovers too. Have to play around with cable height, but I’m getting there.

Got to the gym pretty much right as it opened. My flow was pretty good at first, but the latter half of my workout got griefed by waiting for machines. Couldn’t maintain the same intensity throughout because of this, so that’s something to work on in the future. That or just using a different machine/doing a different movement that targets the same muscle.

Digestion has been wack lately too. Might just have to increase calories, but I lost 1-2 more pounds. Probably sitting at 146 on an empty stomach right now. I’ll see if 140 is enough for abs to come out.

To better days ahead…
