day: 'Chest'

On the bike right now. Been awhile. Working on changing my perceptions of what limits are.

Chest was good today. Up around 160-ish, so been lifting a lot heavier. Pretty close to my old strength level. Gonna keep working and working and working. I want to run a half-marathon after graduating in 2025. Obviously if I put more cardio/running into my routine, I won’t look as big. But I think it’s something I want to do. Always had an issue with long-distance running.

To better days ahead…
