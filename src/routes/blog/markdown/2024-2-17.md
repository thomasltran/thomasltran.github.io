day: 'Legs'

Failed pretty bad today. Had breakfast and everything to go, woke up in time, but didn’t walk over to McComas. Hit legs in the dorm gym again. Can’t grow if I don’t make the effort to put myself in the best position to do so. Can’t remember the last time I hit legs at McComas.

Dude at dinner griefed my diet yesterday. Charged and gave me 2 1/4 pieces of chicken so I paid for and ate more than I wanted to. Trying to not get hung over on these type of things, especially regarding my diet. Just gotta be flexible. As a result, I only ate 2 meals today totaling around 1.2-1.3k calories. Don’t feel that hungry to be honest, but I’ll see after finishing cardio.

To better days ahead…
