Spent basically the entire day at D2. Just ate food and did work. Maybe ate a little too much, but it was pretty good food. Only paid like $5 or something too for an entire day’s worth of eating. Feel pretty full right now while on the bike doing cardio, so I probably won’t get hungry during classes tomorrow. Might be the move to load up on food Sundays and Tuesdays so that I don’t get hungry during classes the next day, although it’s a little counterproductive for trying to get a six-pack. Cut has gone on for longer than I anticipated now, and I miss being able to eat anything I want. The six-pack is gonna be worth it though, and I can always eat after I get it.

To better days ahead…
