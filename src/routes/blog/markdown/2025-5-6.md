Shouldn't have agreed to wake up early. Still having trouble falling asleep, shut off at around 1. Woke up at 5:45 to my alarm and energy levels were depleted. Decided to postpone the gym until later in the day and tried sleeping again. Finally shut off at around 7 and woke up at 12.

Probably around 174-176 right now. Felt it in the gym too. Tried going for 250 (+7) on the incline hammer strength, but couldn't get the initial lockout. Down to 4 ish reps with 240 (+7) now. Had to drop down some more so I could reach like 6+ reps. Everything else stayed pretty much the same except for the first movement.

Proportions are looking better. At peak bulk, my waist was just a little smaller than my upper body so it looked kinda blocky. The taper is looking better now, and I'm starting to see the striations peek through a little. Still have a lot more work to do, but getting excited. Need to start relying more on feeler reps to adjust what weights I work with as my strength decreases.

Might need to cut out incline dumbbells and find a machine or something. Not sure what it's called, but I tweaked the area above my right collarbone a couple weeks ago. Just gets triggered a bit every time I carry heavier dumbbells. Don't feel it for any other movement though.

Gym is closed tomorrow, so I'll have to do back at the apartment gym. Not too ideal because there's like no dedicated back equipment, but I'll make it work.

To better days ahead...
