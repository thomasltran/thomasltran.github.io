Got plenty of food today. Working towards finding the optimal amount to maintain current weight at. Still pretty sure that I’m losing weight though.

Not sure if I’m going mad, but I’m pretty sure abs are like 5 pounds from peeking out. Definitely need to drop to 140 to get them more defined. Looking forward to chest day tomorrow—got a wrap ready to go for the microwave for breakfast so that I can go right when the gym opens at 10.

To better days ahead…
