Might be the best chest day I've had since the day I hit 225.

Loaded up 45 + 45 + 25 on each side of the incline hammer strength. Starting to look pretty cool. Did 2 sets of 6 with that, so 230 (+ 7). Going off of bad fuel right now but it's working. Just have to close my eyes and the reps get done.

The pump was crazy. I went up a notch for my sort of mid pec flies on the cable, and it felt a lot better. Got a bench in a spot with a little bit of downlighting. Looked pretty freaky for the rest of my movements at that point. I'm definitely gonna start cutting, or at the very least bringing back the cardio, in a couple of weeks. Won't be drastic change in weight, just enough to reveal more definition. Definitely won't go below 160.

To better days ahead...
