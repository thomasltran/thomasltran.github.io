Getting leaner. I usually don't take pictures, but I kinda wish I did so I can compare with last week and 2 weeks ago. Based on last cut and this cut, it seems like genetically my mid section leans out first, then chest, arms, and legs at the end. Back probably fits somewhere between chest and arms, but I'm not too sure.

Regular day. Starting to drop down on weight for push-downs a bit, but I compensated by having a little more volume. Went higher for forearms and bicep stuff, and it felt pretty good. Just trying to maintain strength as best I can.

Sat at 175 after the lift, so a meal + a liter-ish of water. Vascularity should be coming in more within the next 10 lbs. Last time, my arms were still too skinny because I didn't train them properly with the bench focus. A year of having a dedicated arm day should make a difference this time, but don't know how much size I'll retain.

It's been awhile since I looked at myself up close, and the difference in size is huge. I remember after not looking at myself for a couple months last year, and one day seeing a reflection in a door I got super surprised. Should probably take more pictures because it's good to track/compare progress over time, but it's not my style. Don't wanna allocate too much energy to analyzing or tracking progression, rather just enjoy the lifts day-by-day.

To better days ahead...
