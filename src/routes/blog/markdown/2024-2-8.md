Settling in pretty decently into the school + gym balance. Routine is fine overall, but just need to get more sleep for recovery. Only been managing like 7 hours at most.

Ate 3 french fries today because the person gave them to me when I only asked for chicken. No complaints—I’ve been craving junk food since I started cutting. In the grand scheme of things 3 fries won’t do anything (probably like 30 calories), but it felt so nice to eat them. Definitely won’t make eating junk food a part of my diet, but maybe a bite every once in a while since I’m still trying to get a 6 pack. I think as long as the junk food doesn’t equate to more than like 50 calories it’s fine to have a taste once every month or so.

To better days ahead…
