Hitting legs at McComas is the move. Legs are still hurting from yesterday. Could’ve done a better job stretching, but the machines there just stimulated my muscles so much better. Powering through cardio right now before dinner.

Early morning errand took longer than expected so I had to skip breakfast and pay the lunch price at D2 for brunch instead. Felt like I ate a lot. I did compensate for missing breakfast, so having a big meal all at once was super satisfying. Reminded me of a last year’s bulk. Food was super good too.

Digestive system has been acting up a whole lot since Sunday. I have been eating a bunch of yogurt fruit bowl concoctions and fruits (pineapples and strawberries) at D2, so that might be a factor. On the other hand, also been getting a whole lot of protein in without that many vegetables due to the food options so that’s probably another factor. Looking forward to chest tomorrow.

To better days ahead…
