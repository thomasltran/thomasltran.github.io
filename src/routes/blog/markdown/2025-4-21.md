day: 'Arms'

Whole schedule is focused around the gym now. I used to rush out the door with like 2 slices of bread, but now I'm taking my time to eat/hydrate before going. Other responsibilities are gonna suffer, but that's the sacrifice.

Weights didn't move as well for arms today. It's been like 2 weeks I think since I've had a proper arm day at McComas, so I think the form got a bit rusty. I think I can go a little heavier though, especially for bicep movements. I've generally stuck to higher rep ranges for arms because the weight that'd be manageable at 4-6 reps would mess up my form. For arms, I like to have the feeling/contraction. Still though, higher rep ranges (8+) feel a little too easy, and for something like incline curls I lose my focus after like 1 set. Gonna keep experimenting. Wasn't able to fit in dips, but blasted my triceps pretty hard.

To better days ahead...
