Said no more rest days until the end of the semester, but that was wishful thinking. Stayed up until 6 to work on a project, and spent the whole day still working on it. Not a good excuse, but I should be more rested tomorrow to hit chest.

Water shut off at the apartment tonight. Was gonna try to fit some push-ups in to keep the muscles warm, but I guess I'm taking a full rest day.

Lowkey due for something good at this point. Ever since spring break everything has been on a downhill trajectory. I think the only thing I really have the means to fully manage and control in my life is the gym. Just gotta keep focusing on it and it'll be the way out.

The issue is that I can't let go of something until I'm satisfied with the way it's finished. The move would be to straight up have a cutoff time where I go to bed at, and that way I'll always have time for the gym in the morning. Need to learn how to detach from things. I think that's another reason why I like the gym so much. It's simpler to detach from reality when I need to concentrate everything on lifting, and that becomes therapeutic in a way. Maybe that's why I used to enjoy playing video games when I was younger.

Looking forward to the chest pump tomorrow. Absolutely no way I'm gonna have a repeat of today.

To better days ahead...
