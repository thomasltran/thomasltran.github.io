Legs were pretty decent. Waited a bit for machines, but not too bad. Still working on overcoming the pain barrier on legs to squeeze out the last few partials.

Leg extension machine was kind of scuffed. The track of it was semi-ribbed or something, so it wasn’t smooth when moving. Still trying to find a good routine to fall into in terms of warm-up reps and working sets that properly activates the muscle but doesn’t take too much time.

As always, doing cardio right now and my legs are about to give out any second. Might try find a way to get in cardio before leg days, but I don’t fancy the idea of waking up even earlier.

To better days ahead…
