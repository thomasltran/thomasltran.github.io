Improving at my technique for arms. Still don’t think I’m fully there yet for triceps, but pumps have been feeling super good. Gonna miss the preacher curl machine here when I go back on campus Sunday.

Haven’t took any progress pictures in awhile. Not sure what it is, but I’d much rather just do a quick pump check in the mirror and be done with it.

To better days ahead…
