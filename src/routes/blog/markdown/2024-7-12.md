day: 'Chest'

Decent past couple of days. Been having some good interactions at the gym.

Went up again for incline bench today. Did like 175 for 6 reps 2 sets. Trying to be mindful of slowing on the way down to maximize muscle growth. Used a different bench today for incline db bench, but I think I screwed up the angle. Front delts felt toasted way before chest did.

To better days ahead...
