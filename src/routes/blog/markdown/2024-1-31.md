Decent back pump today. Lot’s of waiting in between sets for machines again—pretty much 5-10 minutes every time. Still made it work.

Felt a lot stronger today. I went up on weight, and will probably need to keep doing so in small increments. Haven’t focused a lot on progressive overload during the cut because it felt like I was either maintaining or losing my strength. Felt nice to be moving heavier weight today.

Also been intaking a lot more carbs lately. Not a huge amount, but enough to keep me fueled. Both yesterday and today for dinner, I ate a chicken sandwich since it was more convenient/the spots with my usual chicken breast and vegetables wasn’t open. Bread tastes so good, and based on the nutrition facts, I’m still staying at like 1700-1800 calories a day.

Pretty sure I’ve been getting leaner since I came back from break. Hopefully visible abs appear by spring break.

To better days ahead…
