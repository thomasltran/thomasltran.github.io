Good sleep and good pump. Got so much sleep I woke up thinking it was Thursday, and then Sunday, and then finally realized it was Saturday. Crazy. Ate a sandwich I bought the day before since chicken fajita wraps weren’t available. Probably gonna be a pretty low calorie day today.

Felt pretty weak on a lot of my movements today. Legs are still jacked from Friday. Still gave it a pretty good go. Also modified my side delt exercises and they feel a lot better. For dumbbell lateral raises, I switched to a much wider angle, and they feel a lot better this way. Also, I changed up how I do them on cables too. Saw a clip about raising the cable up more. I think it feels better compared to my usual leaning cable lateral raises.

Cardio has been a grind lately. Hardest part is finding entertainment that can stimulate me the entire 30 minutes. Basically ran out of stuff to watch. Legs feel super heavy.

To better days ahead…
