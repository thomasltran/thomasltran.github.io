Woke up with my right trapped tweaked. Hope it gets better before chest tomorrow. Bus back to school. Got a mega headache from the bouncing back and forth.

Finally got to eat chinese food again. Devoured the beef and broccoli, fried rice, and chicken skewers in one go. My mind is still off from the diet restriction I had while cutting. Need to fix it as soon as possible by training myself to eat what I want. Was probably like a month away from an eating disorder not gonna lie.

To better days aheadâ€¦
