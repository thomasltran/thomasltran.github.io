It’s been pretty rough with the gym. I’ve been inconsistent with my schedule. Haven’t gone in a week. After benching 225 I turned directly to cutting. And I think that’s what kept me consistent. I had another clear goal. Ever since then, I’ve sort of entered the free play mode of the game. There’s no end goal, you pretty much play until you feel bored. And that’s what’s happened. I’m wandering around in circles.
