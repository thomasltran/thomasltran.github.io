Good lift. Realized I was doing rope tricep extensions incorrectly. Needed to step back further to get more tension. Getting more and more vascular and ever since I added forearms back into the mix, pumps are looking pretty freaky.

Switched back to doing incline curls and hammer curls on the bench instead of cables. Based on my exercise order, it should save time when I go back on campus. The stimulus I got from curls on cables felt pretty similar to the preacher curl machine anyways, so it should be better overall.

To better days aheadâ€¦
