First lift back on campus. Went to the gym 5 minutes after it opened and it was basically full. Defaulted to incline dumbbell press since the benches were all taken. Didn’t feel that bad compared to last time I did it—possibly because the equipment here is better than at home. Got a pretty good chest pump and it’s looking pretty freaky.

Missed the lateral raise machine a lot. Didn’t get as good a side delt pump, but worked with what I had.

Gonna keep trying to wake up earlier and get workouts in before 10 AM. Hopefully it’s not as crowded during this time interval.

To better days ahead…
