day: 'Chest'

Almost took a rest day today. Woke up and my head was telling me to let the right side of my chest rest. Decided to just go anyways and it didn't really bother me. Got a good pump too.

Pretty much staying at the same weight/rep range for the incline hammer strength. Not sure how much more I can progress on it before cutting, but I'm bumping up the weight on my other movements in the meantime. Focused a lot on trying to feel the muscle today. I think I might need to bump down the weight a bit on back, or at least do fewer reps to get a better contraction. It feels super nice for chest.

Pump check was kind of crazy. I'm at my biggest right now, and eating relatively healthy has produced good results. Part of me kind of wants to maintain the same weight so that I can test out my strength when I get back home, but I really want to start on the cut as soon as possible. Will probably just get a feel and adjust if needed.

To better days ahead...
