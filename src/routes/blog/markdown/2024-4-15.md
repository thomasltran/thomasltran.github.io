day: 'Back'

Didn’t turn on the ringer so I woke up pretty late. Went to the gym around 10 and got about my day as usual. Back felt pretty pumped. Weather is like 70-80 degrees this week so my body is like primed for the gym—I think that warmer temperatures allows for like your muscles to stay ready and stuff.

Typing this at 2:18 AM on the 16th. Doing some work and watching Jason’s stream right now. Turned 20. I want to work my butt off. Cardio tomorrow—probably gonna do the bike like 5 times a week because of classes on Mondays and Wednesdays.

To better days ahead…
