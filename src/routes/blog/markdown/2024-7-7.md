Turns out the gym closed early on Saturday. Ended up taking two days off. Wasn't too bad though, got a lot of rest in and did work.

Went heavy today. Got to repping like 170 on incline bench for like 6 reps. Felt super nice. Afterwards decided to go up on incline db's too and got like 5-6 reps of 70. Looking to max out Audrey Moore's db's by the end of the summerâ€”goes up to 75.

Not super happy with the way the body is looking right now. Pretty much like 75% bulked right now, so pretty little definition and my chest looks pretty small. Planning to hop on creatine soon. If I can find it at Costco it's wraps. Feeling like it's the next phase of this journey once I hop on it. Not like 100% sure though because I have to change my water intake habits first.

To better days ahead...
