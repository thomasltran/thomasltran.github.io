day: 'Chest'
---

Didn’t get that sleep. Still got a pretty freaky chest pump. There’s like an underlying vein on my left pec that would look super cool once I get leaner. Scale still says that I’m the same weight-ish, so maybe just cutting out the waffles isn’t enough.

Felt like 80% strength in the gym today. I think it’s because I changed my bedding yesterday, and lifting up the mattress and stuff took a toll on my muscles. Probably gonna time that  better and do it the day before a rest day or something for optimal recovery.

Feeling super tired today. Cardio hasn’t been good for me lately. Still doing my best right now to hammer it out before classes, but I honestly could use a nap. Pacing is super off right now and I’d be happy if I can reach 300 calories before 30 minutes today. Also could spend the 30 minutes doing other things, but I can’t bring myself to skip it. Just gonna keep powering through.

To better days ahead…
