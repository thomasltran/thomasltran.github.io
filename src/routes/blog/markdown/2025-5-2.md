Crashing out harder than last time. Stalled for 3 hours before I got out of the apartment. Don't know what it was, I felt pressure to lift heavy or something.

Went on the bench again, first time since October 23rd, 202023. I worked up to about 155 but it didn't feel too good. Or mentally it didn't feel too good. Like I could picture myself getting a pec tear. Don't regret it though. After each set, everything was coming back to me. The routine, the setup, the muscles. Super nostalgic. Don't know if I'll ever bench again, but I'm glad I tried it again today.

Didn't want to expend any more strength on the bench, so I went over to the incline hammer strength. Just needed to get it all out today. Loaded up 240 (+7) and repped it for 6. Lift today was straight up just pumping out sets and getting it all out.

Can't describe how I felt, or how I'm feeling right now. Directionless? I don't know. It's like I'm drifting around, but I always force myself back in the gym because there's something to find there.

Cut starts today, sitting at around 177 after 1 meal + water. Don't know if I have time for cardio tonight, but hopefully I'll find a way. The pump is looking pretty good. Don't want to get too lean that I look small, but lean enough so the striations and vascularity look freaky.

To better days ahead...
