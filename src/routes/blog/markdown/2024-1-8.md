Continuing to drop weight on pretty much every machine. Probably a smart move since I think I tweaked my lower back again doing leg extensions a couple weeks ago. Also found out that leg press was feeling off because the back rest angle was adjusted too far back, so fixing it solved some problems.

Making it a priority to improve on tempo/breathing more. My ability to do this drastically decreased when I opted for a quicker style of training where I pumped out as many reps as I could then switched to partials. Lots of Mentzer clips have been popping up on my algorithm lately so it’s probably a sign to slow down the reps.

Body is a little roughed up from the cut. Test levels 100% took a hit. It’s difficult to feel that same energy and almost primal state of mind I had during the bulk/journey to 225. In the future I gotta take it much slower instead of depriving myself of food. Super funny was seriously considering taking creatine or pre-workout to compensate for this but I’d rather just give it time.

To better days ahead…
