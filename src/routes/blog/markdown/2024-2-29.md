day: 'Chest'

Typical chest day. Been eating a lot more but didn’t feel stronger compared to normal today. Didn’t like my intensity today. Felt like I just turned on autopilot and went through the movements without much thought. I want to focus on only the muscle groups I’m targeting and not other things while I’m in the gym. Probably need to stop playing Clash of Clans on my phone in-between sets.

Chest pumps feel super good. It’s like one of the only body parts that I feel I’m pumping up too much. Like it’s close to bursting or something after a good pump.

They didn’t have rice or any decent carb options initially at D2 for lunch today. Decided to make myself 1/2 a waffle after weeks to go with my fruit yogurt bowl. It was so good. When I was about to leave, the rice finally came out so I decided to get a bowl with squash/eggplant and some more grilled chicken. Went over calories today but that waffle was so delectable.

Going back on Saturday. Looking forward to hitting back tomorrow (with a hopefully emptier gym) and eating the rest of the day. Also need to get ahead on work.

To better days ahead…
