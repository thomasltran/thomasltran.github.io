Need to figure out something for cardio. Last year, I able to use the bike downstairs in my dorm gym. The apartment gym is a little further away, so need to figure out a way to work it into my schedule. Probably needs to happen first thing in the morning so I can shower and stuff afterwards. Don't want it too close to my lifts though because I want to come in fresh. If I can't fit in cardio, I'll just keep walking and cutting down calories. Should slow down the rate of cutting too, so I can have more time to maintain strength.

Usual back day. Been increasing volume a bit. Bumping this [song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1EryAkZ0VHstC6haIxVBiE?si=586d6afc98844c16) on repeat lately to fill in noise. Continuing to push it as far as I can, but I think I can give more. Usually, I stop 2-3 partials after my form gives out. I think I can take like a quick pause, then force a final rep in most cases though.

Should have a little more free time the next couple of weeks, so I want to get super dialed for this cut. Lifting is the simple part because it's already part of my routine, but I want to achieve like clarity or something. Just being able to intentionally avoid and cut things out that don't positively contribute.

To better days ahead...
