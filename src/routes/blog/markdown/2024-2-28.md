Good eating today. Cutting back a little for lunch. I’ve probably been eating like 700-800 calories worth of chicken for lunch at D2, which isn’t exactly conducive to cutting. Learned that jasmine rice doesn’t have a lot of fiber either. Pretty much have been getting 0 fiber in my diet. Explains a lot of the digestive issues, as well as my high cholesterol. Been trying to eat a bunch of fruit and berries to compensate. Forgot the banana today.

Can’t wait to go home for spring break. Food here has gotten a bit boring since I’ve been eating the same thing every day. Looking forward to having more fruits and veggies that aren’t frozen or loaded with butter.

Skipped a class to do cardio today. No way I’m gonna do it at night after my last class. Legs are still hurting from yesterday but pushing through best I can. Not sure if I’ll be spending tomorrow here or going home, but I’ll be getting a chest pump either way.

To better days ahead…
