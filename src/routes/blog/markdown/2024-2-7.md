day: 'Legs'

Hit legs in the dorm gym. Quads when doing leg extensions look side. Right one still looks pretty different than left side because of the quad tear I got a couple years ago, but still looks pretty freaky. Tried my best to keep the intensity pretty high to compensate for the lack of optimal equipment.

Getting cardio out of the way before classes again. I think as long as I maintain this sort of cardio scheduling for Mondays and Wednesdays, school shouldn’t take too much of a toll on my energy when working out. Just have to keep getting used to it, since doing this like an hour-ish after hitting legs makes it more difficult.

To better days ahead…
