Back on the podcast arc. Used to listen to them everyday when I ate in dining halls or walked to class, but haven't done so as much this year. Just needed something other than music to fill in the silence outside of the gym. Was getting worried about the noise exposure too, just been cranking the volume super loud. Listening to [this one](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shawn-ryan-show/id1492492083?i=1000543048578) right now.

Good arm day. Took things a little slower to lock in the form, but still went pretty heavy today. Right side of my chest still hasn't fully recovered yet, and I felt my lower back tweak again towards the end of the lift. Nothing to complain about though, I'm happy with how the weights were moving. Can't wait to see more definition on the arms. I think I can definitely maintain most of the size if I keep going heavy.

I think I can hold off on the cardio for these first couple of weeks. I'm probably eating a little under 2k calories a day right now, so that deficit should be enough to slowly cut away. Been trying a new thing lately where I avoid eating processed foods.

To better days ahead...
