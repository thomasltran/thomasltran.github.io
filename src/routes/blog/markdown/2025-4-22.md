Got a new music update. Been blasting random synth music in the mornings and on bus rides. At this point my music taste is just random noise to flood out the thoughts.

Gonna be more late nights for the next couple of days. I've been taking naps during the daytime so I'm still getting 6+ hours of sleep in total.

Did legs and abs at the apartment gym again. Trying to slowly increase the weight for legs and get back to where I was in August. I think the back thing might be super long-term or even permanent, but as long as I can keep lifting I don't mind.

2 splits without a rest day, still feeling pretty good. To be honest, legs + abs are basically my rest days. Kind of sad since I should be going way harder for legs, but that's how it is for now.

To better days ahead...
