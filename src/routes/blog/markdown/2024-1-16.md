Went at 9 AM and it was basically full again. Just gonna have to deal with it. Wasn’t too bad because I was done around 10:20, which is about an extra 20 minutes more or less.

Pretty good pump. Only mistake was going too heavy on lat pulldowns so I couldn’t focus on the muscles as much. Learned something about the high to low machine row I usually do too—if you lean too far back, it’s essentially like doing standard cable rows because of the scapular plane. Not too sure if I should continue keeping this in the routine, or switch over to lat pullovers.

Back looks pretty different now. A lot of mass loss, but the lower back definition is starting to kick in. Pretty pumped about that. Gotta learn how to properly do some poses too.

To better days ahead…
