Struggling to focus on anything. I think I need to just get the gym out of the way first thing before I do anything else. Expend some energy so I can't think too much.

Almost didn't make it today. Was like 95% on not going, but decided to get out at 10:30 at night for the apartment gym. Did whatever came to mind for back. I don't usually do pull-ups because I can't feel it as much, so I just tried doing a bunch at the beginning to substitute for the usual lat pulldowns. Wasn't the best back day because of the equipment, but still got a decent pump. Another hotel type lift. Looking forward to going back to McComas tomorrow.

Definitely should be weighing myself in the mornings to get more accurate results. I don't have a scale here, so I'm just basing it off of what I look like after waking up. Gonna do it when I go back home. Would not be surviving without the meal delivery stuff. Would be spending at least $40 on Uber Eats or something a day, but instead this is $6 a meal so it's not too bad. Been eating a lot more salmon lately for the heart stuff. Super little beef in the diet, mainly chicken and salmon. Probably just gonna stick to chicken breast when I get home, and maybe occasionally 93/7 ground beef or something.

Starting to crave stuff. Just wanna eat a bunch of chicken nuggets and brownies. Gonna be awhile though.

To better days ahead...
