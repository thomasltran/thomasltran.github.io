Santa came through and got me lifting straps for Christmas. Been getting pretty good pumps on back days because of them. Weight is maintaining pretty nicely (+1 ish pounds), and I’ll probably sit here for a bit.

Super good lift today. Dropped weights on basically all of the machines and focused on getting a better contraction. Freaky pump, but I gotta learn how to properly pose to get the full effect.

To better days ahead…
