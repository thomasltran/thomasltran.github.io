Super nice back pump today. Form and technique is getting better, but I suspect some muscle imbalances between my left and right side. Either that or my anatomy is just set up that way.

Haven't worn shorts to the gym since I got here because of the weather. Lifts and everything felt better because I was able to see the vascularity pop up as the lifts went on. Having fun and enjoying the process.

Gonna do the same thing as last week and pre-buy a wrap to microwave tomorrow morning so I can hit arms right when the gym opens.

To better days aheadâ€¦
