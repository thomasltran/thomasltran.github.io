Legs have probably suffered the most from cutting in terms of strength. Lifts were pretty rough today, and energy felt off. I have this brain fog that kicks in after I do leg press that makes me feels super sleepy. Still powered through best I could though.

Might try to find a different exercise for lower abs. Been doing hanging leg raises but I can’t feel it that much compared to the crunch machine, where my middle abs get a lot of tension.

Definitely need to fix sleep schedule too. Since coming home from break I’ve slept in like two four hour intervals. One after dinner, and the second around 5 AM after doing work.

To better days ahead…
