Tried to do incline dumbbells instead of bench this time. Don’t like it at all. Felt like I wasted a ton of energy on the setup and front delts were definitely way more activated. In general, I don’t think it’s smart to start off with incline dumbbells. You don’t wanna lead with a movement that relies on stretching/slowing stuff down without already being warmed up, and it also wastes being able to initially push around higher weights like on the incline bench.

Tried to switch up the exercise order today; it went okay. Also focused more on high-low flies and my positioning. I watched a Sam Sulek video talking about the most tension occurring at the contracted position of the movement since it’s cables. Chest flies haven’t been feeling that good recently which is a shame.

Watching one of [Mentzer’s](https://youtu.be/c8CXe7PvEXo?si=HqUkyGAtF6x77kQ0) seminars right now and I’m thoroughly enjoying it.

To better days ahead…
