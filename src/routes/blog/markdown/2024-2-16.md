Didn’t wake up as early as I’d like, but still ate breakfast and made it out to McComas. Pretty good arm pump. Form on tricep movements still need some work I think, but I don’t really know whether or not to pump out reps versus keeping it controlled. I’ve seen lots of people do both, so I guess I’ll keep trying things out and pick something I like.

Biceps are looking pretty crazy. Felt a little stronger today so I think I was hitting higher rep ranges. Having a lot of fun. Cutting out things that don’t matter and dialing in now. I’m gonna keep sticking with the diet until I get a six-pack then eat relatively normally again.

To better days ahead…
