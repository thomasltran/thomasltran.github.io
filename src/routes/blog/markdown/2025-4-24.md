Made everything happen today. Took care of school and got a good chest pump in.

I lost a couple pounds, I think just from diet alone. Don't wanna spend money getting Uber Eats everyday, so I'm probably sitting at around 2.1-2.4k calories a day right now. Down to like 176 lbs from 181 a couple days ago. Pretty big difference, but I was just 1 rep weaker today for the most part. Body is looking better though after eating healthy stuff.

Kept everything at pretty much the same weight today. Should be in a good spot if I can continue to maintain while my body recomps before I start cutting.

Still not 100% sure on the heart thing. Don't know what it is, but there's like a sharp thing right under it. Felt it during chest flies and I was about to stop, but just decided to keep going. Hopefully nothing too bad.

To better days ahead...
