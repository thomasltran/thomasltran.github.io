Solid arm pump. Same things with tempo and form. Food options a little scarce this week compared to last but making do.

Probably hitting legs in the dorm gym again tomorrow to save time before class for cardio. Much more convenient and not too much of a loss compared to going to McComas.

To better days aheadâ€¦
