Looking leaner. Obliques are coming in more and way less bloated in the morning. For the first week last time around, I felt super hungry at night when I tried to sleep. Haven't experienced it that much yet, so I might need to cut out more calories. I'm sort of doing everything based on intuition right now and what I look/feel like rather than numbers. A lot less stressful.

Continuing to work on shutting things out. For a moment I almost convinced myself to skip today, but pushed on anyways. Worrying about things I shouldn't be worrying about.

I think next split I can incorporate back in pressing movements and calf raises for legs again. Lower back isn't getting triggered by movements as long as I keep the form in check.

Starting to see some more changes in the physique. More definition and things looking a bit tighter.

Planning to get a lift in with my buddy tomorrow at like 6 in the morning. I think the last time I went to the gym with someone was with my other buddy on 10/23/202023, the day I hit 225 on bench. Not sure if I prefer going solo, but I haven't had enough sessions with someone else to reach a conclusion. Online, people almost always have a lifting partner to spot/help get partials. Don't think there's a downside to having someone else. Like if I'm already pushing hard solo, theoretically having someone else should help me go harder. Not too big on waking up that early thoughâ€”it'll be a one-time thing.

To better days ahead...
