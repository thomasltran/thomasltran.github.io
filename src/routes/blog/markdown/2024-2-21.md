Arm day. Still looking to improve on form for triceps. Went heavier today and got fewer reps, but I still felt pretty pumped. Watching Sam Sulek again has definitely got me doing heavier weight, although the form has to be sacrificed to some extent.

Griefed myself from getting 100 on a midterm but pretty much done until spring break next week. Gotta wrap up 1 or 2 things but other than that I’m dialed into the gym. Got a buddy of mine coming back in July so it’ll be nice to hit the gym then. In the meantime there’s a 100% chance I’m hitting legs at McComas tomorrow. It’s been way too long.

To better days ahead…
