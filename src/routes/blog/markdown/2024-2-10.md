Quick back day. Got through everything pretty nicely. Haven’t done the underhand grip high-low machine row in a while. I switched over to the single-arm lat pullover thing I saw Sam Sulek doing, and it feels pretty good. Plus it’s a good alternative to save time when the other machine isn’t open. Trying out different angles to see which works best with this movement.

Decent pump. Still haven’t learned how to pose, but I guess I’ll get to it when my physique gets better. Had a lot of fun running into some old buddies at the gym. I go by myself 99% of the time, so having a chat every now and then is a welcome thing. Gonna try to keep the diet pretty strict this week (this means no waffles for breakfast) so I’ll see how maintainable it is alongside my increased academic activity. 

To better days ahead…
