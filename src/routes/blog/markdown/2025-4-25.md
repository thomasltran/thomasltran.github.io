Weight is continuing to drop. Sitting at around 175-176 now. Weights felt a bit heavier, but still continuing to push through. Gonna try to avoid dropping down in weight/reps as much as I can.

Not sure if I should continue sticking with the attachment I've been using for lat pulldowns for the past year or so. I think I should go with a little narrower grip, like shoulder width, but not too sure about that. Like on a standard lat pulldown bar the move is usually to grip right outside of the bend. That's wider than shoulder width, so I think the same logic applies? Either way, I'm like 70% sure I'm gonna buy the mag grip or a cheaper knockoff when I get back home.

I think either my ribs are bruised from coughing or something else is causing the heart stuff. When I was doing the single-arm pullovers, I strained too hard and it happened. Gonna be more careful, but I don't wanna take a break from the gym again. Whatever happens happens I guess.

To better days ahead...
