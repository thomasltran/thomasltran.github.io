Great chest pump. Incline bench on the smith machine and the lateral raise machine felt so nice today. Got a bunch of tension on my chest and side delts, but for some reason I don’t feel fully pumped up.

Still have lots to do over spring break. Been losing my usual rhythm ever since I stopped doing cardio after coming home. Need to get the momentum back to make the next couple of weeks easier to get through.

Not dropping weight like I hoped would happen when I came back. Been eating 2 meals a day but they’re pretty big, plus the huge amount of fruit I’ve been getting. Definitely feel healthier, but just not losing weight as a result. 

To better days ahead…
