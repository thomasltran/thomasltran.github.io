Still having trouble falling asleep. Might need to do something. Last year on the cut, I used to read [[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami)] like an hour before bed to clear my mind. Haven't read since the summer, but I might need to bring it back into the mix. Might pick up some Shakespeare again, always enjoyed reading it in high school.

Was short on time, so I decided to get a quick lift in at the apartment gym. I call these types of lifts "hotel lifts" because I just do it off of feel. I have to deviate from my usual movements, and just do stuff based on my intuition and the equipment available to get as pumped as possible in 30-40 minutes. Arms felt pretty good. I did a bunch of supersetting between triceps/biceps to save on time, and the pump was crazy.

Still not sure about benching again on Friday. Definitely need to start the cut soon though, because I can feel the heart stuff coming back. Just been way too long without doing cardio.

To better days ahead...
