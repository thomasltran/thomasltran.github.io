I feel the surge of energy I had last week gradually fading out. Truly so much of lifting is up in your mind. I've been spending a lot of late nights reflecting lately, and I still don't have a good reason why I lift. I'm almost certain that if I had never gone to the gym in the first place freshmen year, my life would be so much better. I've missed out on every college experience my high school friends have had, and I can't think of a good reason why I went down this path. I think the simple answer is that lifting is one of the only things in my life that I want to do.

Going up a bit heavier for legs. The back pain hasn't spiked like it used to yet, so I'm gonna continue to keep building. 

Refining my techinique and getting better engagement with my abs.

Right side of my chest is a little off right now. It was definitely from arms yesterday, I think I went too heavy and my body wasn't ready for it. Hopefully it doesn't hinder chest day tomorrow too much.

Don't think I'll have time to start on cardio this week. I should have time to start on Friday night though, so that's probably gonna be the start of the cut. Writing blog posts on the bike again is gonna be cool.

To better days ahead...
