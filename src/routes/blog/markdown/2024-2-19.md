Freaky chest pump. Felt stronger than usual because of the surplus of food from yesterday. Gained like 1-2 lbs but it should shed right off by like tomorrow. Bumping the new Yeat album helped set the tone. Pretty happy with the intensity today.

Got cardio done before classes again. Looking forward to back tomorrow. Pretty sure I eat too much at lunch when I eat at D2, so gonna restrain myself tomorrow when I go.

Six-pack before I turn 20. Gonna maintain for a bit, then 1 month before if there’s no significant changes I’m going sub-1500 calories a day.

To better days ahead…
