Continuing to push it. Couldn't fall asleep, worrying over a bunch of things. The bus ride to the gym was pretty bad, but once I started everything just went away. Gonna be a busy week, but need to keep prioritizing showing up because my mind needs it.

Feeling the weights move a bit easier. Haven't progressed too drastically on back, but I can feel it coming along. Nothing special about today, it just felt like a regular gym session where I turned on autopilot and bumped random music.

To better days ahead...
