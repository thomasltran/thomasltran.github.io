Did arms at the apartment gym today. Spent the morning/afternoon working on a project. It's like I'm trying to maximize both the gym and academics (e.g. just one of my classes) right now, and I'm kind of stuck on which one I want to put more time towards. Gym for sure.

Just had a different type of vibe today. Workout was somewhat structured, but I was really just moving weight and doing whatever I wanted to get good pump. Been hitting dips a lot lately for triceps, and I think they're doing some good. My form is probably super bad, but the ROM I get helps to stretch out whatever joints it uses.

My arms got super pumped afterwards. I'm so bulked up at this point that they lowkey look small because the definition isn't there, but it's the biggest they've ever been. 

I think I've been drifting more towards the vibes I worked off of when I first got started in the gym. For like the past year-ish, it's been more of like tapping into good music and having a good time. Not a good thing to revert, but I have a feeling I'm gonna see some substantial gains.

Plan is no more rest days for the rest of the semester. Don't think I can afford to take one at this point. Don't want to either.

To better days ahead...
