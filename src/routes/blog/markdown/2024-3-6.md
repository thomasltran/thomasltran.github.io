Good back pump. Just focused on shutting down the muscle groups as best I could. Cranked up the intensity a lot more today.

Going through a rough time with food and stuff. Gained a pound (probably off of fruit alone), and it’s not a big deal but I feel bad about eating stuff. I think I’m just gonna eat whatever I want—besides junk food—regardless of quantity. Feels like I’ve been cutting for way too long now and it’s taken a toll. Also got other things to focus on besides my body and food, and I think I want to prioritize them now.

Not where I want to be in terms of work done so far during spring break. Been cranking it up a lot, but I still have more to do. Trying to get clarity or something I don’t know. Guess the best thing to do is keep working. Almost 4 AM right now. Been awhile since I stayed up—reminds me of high school.

To better days ahead…
