Weights keep on moving. All the variables that affect lifting (sleep, food, weight, etc.) indicate that I shouldn't be getting stronger right now, but it's happening. I wonder how much of it is mental. After what happened last week, I've just been on a crazy run. Like if my mentality can play such a huge part, I've been holding myself back pretty hard.

Continuing to go pretty heavy on lat pulldowns. They didn't have the mag grip today, so I had to go back to the old neutral grip bar. I saw a video from Maxwell Krause a few weeks back about how going super heavy on lat pulldowns sort of forces you to be in the lengthened position towards the end, so I've been trying it out.

Switched to a different grip today for cable rows. I think it did the trick. Don't think I've felt my lats this pumped. Finished off with the hammer strength rows with 3 plates a side. In the past I'd do these single arm, but I think the leverage made it too easy, and I couldn't feel the contraction as much. Doing it both hands makes it so I don't have to spend time loading/offloading as many plates too.

Brain has just been super foggy since the 4 day bender. Doesn't matter much for the gym, but I need to get it back sooner than later. Can't have it all though, I'm just happy I'm back to peak strength.

To better days ahead...
