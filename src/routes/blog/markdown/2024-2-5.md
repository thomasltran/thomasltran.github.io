Decent back pump today. Trying to keep going up on weight, but sometimes I get too ambitious and it ends up ruining the set. Training back lately has been super focused on tempo. Also, I think that I leaned/tilt a bit to my left side when doing lat pulldowns. Not sure if it’s because of my shoulder abnormalities there, but need to be more cognizant of this to prevent imbalances.

Doing cardio before classes start again. Instead of eating at D2 for lunch, decided to get a chicken sandwich to save time. Whoever made it loaded me up with chicken. I love eating bread. Also love it once I get to around the 150 calories mark. Sometimes I enter a flow state and just get hyper-focused on the rhythm of the bike. Live for these moments.

To better days ahead…
