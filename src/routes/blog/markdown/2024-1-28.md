day: 'Legs'

Focused in on tempo for legs today, but felt super weak. I think it’s because I had no carbs for breakfast (only beef and broccoli), so the fuel wasn't there. Need to keep experimenting with diet throughout the day. Haven't weighed myself in a couple of days, but I think I'm still around 150 give or take 1 or 2 pounds.

Post-workout fatigue hit a little harder today. Again, probably because the lack of carbs, but it didn't feel good. My body and mind overall just feels a lot weaker than like last week when I had higher food intake. Not exactly optimal for school, but it's whatever.

To better days ahead…
