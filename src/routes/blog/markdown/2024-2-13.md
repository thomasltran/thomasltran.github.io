Needed this rest day. Was about to skip cardio but wouldn’t be able to go to sleep at night. Getting work done. Didn’t get much sleep tonight either. Gonna try to compensate for it tonight the best I can to get a freaky chest pump tomorrow. Basically trying to empty the tank as much as I can every day to make the most of my time.

Diet has settled in. Pretty sure I’m still eating too much (4 chicken thingies every day at lunch among other things), but it’s less than what I was consuming before. Miss those waffles for breakfast. Also not getting enough veggies in. Dining options are kinda scarce for those type of foods, but I’ll be on the lookout.

To better days ahead…
