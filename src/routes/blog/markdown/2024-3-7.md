Just tried to pump out reps today. Couldn’t feel as much squeeze and tension as I usually do. Left elbow felt a bit funky on tricep movements too. Love the preacher curl machine back home. Just did a bunch of volume and stopped the movements when I felt like it was enough.

Probably gonna clean bulk for a bit. Restricting myself with food for over 1/3 of a year was a bit too taxing. Like physically I maybe had another month of super strict dieting left in me, but mentally it wasn’t gonna happen. Still gonna eat pretty healthy as far as food goes, so I don’t expect to gain that much weight. The good thing is if I stay within like a 10 lb range of 150, I can get to lower weight on my next cut and hopefully the six pack comes out then.

To better days ahead…
