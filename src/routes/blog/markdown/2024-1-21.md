Not the best back day. Exercise order got a little messed up because I didn’t wanna wait for people to finish. Working on improving form and technique.

Weight going up a little bit. If I had to guess maybe 1-2 lbs in the last couple days. Probably all from Uber Eats since they’ve been running the usual beginning of year offers. Once I run out of discounts and free trials it’ll be back to a pretty substantial deficit. Chinese food is so good.

Got griefed on the bike today. Haven’t had a problem where someone was on it when I went to do cardio before. Decided to switch to treadmill, cranked out some random settings, and getting after it now. More chinese food coming in half an hour.

To better days ahead.
