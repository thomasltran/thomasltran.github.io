Lot’s to say about it, but I’ll just limit it to the gym for the purpose of this blog. I think I went like six days without going to the gym there. Was just sitting around in an AC room all day and only going outside for food. It was pretty unfortunate. Things got better though, and I had a hotel gym for like 3-4 days. Might be the craziest gym I’ve been to in terms of the style. It was like a hut on the side of a lake and had like a thatched roof and stuff. The equipment was like knock-off equipment so it wasn’t really the best, and since it’s super humid there everything is like re-painted so it was a little bit strange. Either way, I was happy to get pumped up again. Going straight to the beach after a chest pump was nuts. After coming back from the hotel, went like a day without the gym, and then had like an apartment gym for the rest of my time there. Basically only had cables, dumbbells, and a bench, so I had to get creative with hitting things (like legs). Still had some decent pumps. Surprisingly, I’ve basically been at the same weight for like the past 2-3 months. Just fluctuating between 160-165 everyday.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1bs4xhw">Flew back on a Saturday, and went to Richmond for an internship onboarding week on Sunday. The gym situation there was way worse than the apartment in Vietnam. Cables were barely useable, so it was just dumbbells and a bench. I think I probably skipped like 2-3 days there and just did whatever I felt like. Learning how to deal with gym situation whilst travelling is pretty important. It’s a good thing that I used to watch Sam Sulek a lot because I think it just comes down to understanding what movements you can do to target a muscle, and knowing what options you have based on your equipment/environment.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1uk4zyt">Been back at Audrey Moore since then. Had like a thing with my eye last week that got me in the ER and out of the gym for like 3 days, but it’s been pretty normal. Recently, I’ve been able to go up weight on a lot of stuff. Hopefully it’s a sign that I got stronger. Not sure if it’s time to cut again, but I’m kind of content with where I’m at right now. Eating whatever and not gaining weight, not getting drastically weaker/stronger, etc. The only issue is I feel like I don’t have a goal to work towards, so it just feels like I’m stuck in a limbo and going through the motions again.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ukv77c">Legs today were alright. Gym closed early at 4 since it’s July 4th, so I went for like 50 minutes; most workouts these days are taking like an hour-ish, so it’s really just been pretty quick and intense.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1tuy26u">Definitely will get back to blogging more often. Still have lots I want to do before the summer is over though, so I’ll see how it goes.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ps3hsh">To better days ahead…</p>`;
