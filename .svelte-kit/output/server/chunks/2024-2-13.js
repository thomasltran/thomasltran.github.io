Basically trying to empty the tank as much as I can every day to make the most of my time.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-hfh8lz">Diet has settled in. Pretty sure I’m still eating too much (4 chicken thingies every day at lunch among other things), but it’s less than what I was consuming before. Miss those waffles for breakfast. Also not getting enough veggies in. Dining options are kinda scarce for those type of foods, but I’ll be on the lookout.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ps3hsh">To better days ahead…</p>`;
