Pretty good pump—was feeling super tired afterwards too.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1uupxci">While the equipment at the dorm gym and McComas are more or less the same for legs (minus the better leg press and dedicated calves machine), the energy I feed off of at McComas can’t be understated. Seeing huge dudes around you makes getting those last couple of reps a lot easier. Definitely not hitting the same numbers the last time I went here, but technique has improved. The janky quad extension machine still hasn’t been fixed, so I had to wait a bit for the better one. Also the leg press there just feels more difficult.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-5hmbbc">Went back to the dorm gym for abs. Taking out hanging leg raises out of the routine and opting for decline sit-ups instead. Used a 6 and 8 pound medicine ball as extra weight since it was all I could find. I think I feel the abs better on this, so probably going to be a staple in the routine for the foreseeable future. Finished off with the standard machine curl-ups.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-17thgx5">The six-pack defining lines aren’t quite there. Need to lose more weight. But there’s some veins that snake down the side and middle of my abdomen that look super freaky. Can’t wait to see how they look when I keep getting leaner.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ps3hsh">To better days ahead…</p>`;
