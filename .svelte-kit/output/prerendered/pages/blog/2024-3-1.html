Intensity was kept up pretty well. Used the same handle as last time for lat pulldowns, but it felt a bit weird at first. My forearms were getting tensed up, and it felt awkward to move. Eventually got the hang of it, but not sure it gave a good pump. Accidentally went too heavy on the single-arm cable rows. Forgot what my usual weight was.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15emui0">I think I did a lot more volume today than usual. Wasn’t in a rush or anything, so just took my time and added sets if I felt like I could get a better pump. Pretty laid back type of day. D2 had cod again and veggies for lunch, so I ate a lot of good food. Been maintaining probably at 148-149 lbs, but it’s probably gonna drop over spring break when I go home tomorrow.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-fihli1">Gonna try to hit arms in the morning. I think I’m going back at around 6-7, so gonna have to wake up at like 5, eat the chicken wrap I got earlier, and go to the dorm gym. Definitely want to get it out of the way before I get home. Just have to sleep earlier tonight I guess.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gyvuxa">Lots to do over spring break. This month pretty much depends on how much I can get done over the next week. Have to dial in now so my gym schedule can stay pretty relaxed after break ends. Cardio consistency is gonna take a hit over break at home too—haven’t missed a day since I got back after winter break.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-ps3hsh">To better days ahead…</p></div></article> </body></article>
